# ðŸ’¸ Git Back Guarantee

Git Back Guarantee is a tool designed to transfer commit activity from one Git repository to another,
allowing you to seamlessly move commit history from account `A` to account `B` without exposing sensitive information about repository `A`.

I'm sure you could have written this script yourself, however this one is for the lazy.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites
- Git
- Bash

## ðŸ“¦ Setting up
To use `gbg`, ensure you have a work repository and a personal repository set up. Follow these steps:
1. Clone your personal repository from your GitHub account. *I strongly suggest that this repository is private.*
2. Set the `user.email` and `user.name` in the local clone of the personal repository to your personal credentials:
```bash
git config user.email dev@personal.com
git config user.name Your Name
```

## ðŸš€ Usage
- When running `gbg`, the following options are available:
    - `-w` - Required: specifies the path to your work repository.
    - `-c` - Required: specifies the path to your personal commits repository.
    - `-b` - Optional: specifies the branch from your work repository that 
            you want to transfer commit activity from (leave empty to use the current branch).
- After running `gbg` navigate to your personal repository and execute:
```bash
git push
```
